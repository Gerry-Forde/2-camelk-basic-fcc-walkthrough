This tutorial demonstrates how to run a simple Java integration in the cloud on OpenShift, apply configuration and routing to an integration, and run an integration as a Kubernetes CronJob.

.Prerequisites

* See the tutorial readme in GitHub: link:https://github.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-basic[].
* You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift {CamelKOCPVersion} cluster to install Camel K. See xref:installing-camel-k-operatorhub[].
* You must have the `kamel` command installed. See xref:installing-camel-k-client-tool[].
* Visual Studio (VS) Code is optional but recommended for the best developer experience. See xref:setting-up-environment[].
